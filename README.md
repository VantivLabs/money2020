We cannot wait to meet everyone and geek out on payment APIs at the Money20/20 Hackathon October 24th and 25th.  We had such a great time participating last year and are eagerly anticipating more of the same great atmosphere this year.  Here is a review from last year if you are interested:

Now let's look forward to the FUTURE!!!

http://vantiv.com/developers -- the articles and this github site will provide all of the info you need for a great hackathon experience.

This specific repo is to provide you a quickstart to integrating to Vantiv APIs.

As you can see from the list above we have made our:  Activate, HostedCheckout, REST, and SOAP integrations available for your hacking pleasure.

REST/SOAP are a transmission mechanism but specifically provide access to our Credit, Debit, EBT, ACH, and PrePaid (aka Gift) products.

#Hackathon Information

##Challenge Statement

We have one goal—to help our customers help their customers enable great experiences at the point of sale—whatever that point of sale—big box retail, small- and medium-sized business, eCommerce or iPOS.  We get collaboration with 3,000 POS ISVs, VARs and us, working to simplify payments innovation to bring exciting products, services and solutions to market.  Hop on the road to creating brilliant new code.  Your creativity and passion.  Our challenge, your task: develop a product that simplifies how people buy, sell or pay via the Vantiv APIs focused on three areas:

* Virtual Reality
* Internet of Things
* Wearables

We provide hardware associated with each of these areas (yours to keep). Fun stuff like iWatches, Raspberry Pi’s, Fitbits and virtual reality kits. Use them or not as you hack, but they’re yours to keep—no flack

##Prize: The Winning Team will be offered:

###Part 1: The Money20/20 Experience 

* A location in the Vantiv Booth for the duration of Money2020 to demo what they developed – value is priceless.
* Hotel and food costs for the winning team for Sunday night – departing Wednesday
* Money20/20 Wardrobe. We want you to look good for Money20/20, so we’ll take you shopping. $200 Gift Cards for each team member.

###Part 2: Vacation or Gear 
* After all this hard work, you’ll need a vacation, so we’ve got a $1,000 travel voucher for each team member. Go surfing in Hawaii or Skiing in Aspen; the choices are endless.

Or 
* If sitting on a beach or flying down a mountain isn’t your thing, we’ll give each member of your team a $1,000 gift card to www.newegg.com, TigerDirect or Amazon.



#Samples in this repo

We use curl to facilitate transaction processing in this repo as it is a simple utility and easily installed (if not installed by default).  But have a look around at our sample code and you will start to see an infinite number of ways to send transactions to the Vantiv platform.
